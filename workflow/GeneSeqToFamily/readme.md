#Input
Input for GeneSeqToFamily workflows are as below
* CDS sequences
* Species Tree
* Gene feature file in JSON format

#Required Tools
GeneSeqToFamily requires the following tools to run workflow successfully:
* TranSeq
* filter fasta by ID
* BLAST
* BLAST parse
* hcluster_sg
* hcluster_sg parser
* T-Coffee
* TranAlign
* TreeBeST
* Aequatus generator

Some tools for data conversion during workflow:
* cut
* Fasta width
* Fasta to tabular

We have developed various tools to help with data preparation for the workflow:
* Ensembl REST API -  This includes tools for retrieving sequences, features and gene trees from Ensembl using its REST API, 
* Ensembl Parser - Tools to parse Ensembl results into the required format for workflow. 
* gff3-to-json - We also developed tool to merge gene feature files and convert them from GFF3 (Gene Feature File) to JSON format.
